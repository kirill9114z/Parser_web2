# Parser_web2
 
My first successful order completed about 2 years ago. All logic is built from the wishes of the employer. Works mainly on Selenium. 
Main functionality:
1) Parsing of goods
2) Analysis of the received data
3) Comparing the data with the previous recorded file
4) Recording results in Exel
5) Automatic activation of the script at the same time every day.
